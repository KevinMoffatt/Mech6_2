# Mech6_2
Code for ME 3230 Mechatronics Project at the University of Utah Group 6.2
You can find a GitHub basic guide here: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
I would highly recommend the desktop app (download here): https://desktop.github.com/
I haven't used it very much and have only really committed to the master, but using 
branches could be helpful
